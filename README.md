# Open-Ended Relational Query
Guide the on chain data retrieval process by providing explicit natural language instructions, via large multimodal models(LMMs) and large language models(LLMs). 

## Why we call it "Open-Ended"?
For information retrival, we want to get back information that matches data we inputed(e.g. images, texts).
Usually in this context, 'match' is used interchangeablly as "being similar/close". This is just too restrictful!
